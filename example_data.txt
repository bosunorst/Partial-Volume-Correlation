The example data included here is the confocal reflection image of collagen gels containing low density of MDA-MB-231 cells.
Images were taken around an isolated single cell, before and after Cytochalasin D treatment.
(Due to size limit of GitHub, the image stacks were splited into two zip compressed files)
cell_membrane.mat is a Matlab file containing the (binary) cell image.
